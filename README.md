# 🤖 AI-Driven Interview Preparation Assistant for Employment Readiness

## 📌 Overview
The **AI-Driven Interview Preparation Assistant** is a web-based application designed to help students and job seekers prepare effectively for interviews.  
It generates **role-specific and experience-level-based interview questions** using a **hybrid AI approach**.

This project is developed as part of the **IBM SkillsBuild / CSRBOX Applied AI Internship Capstone Project** and is aligned with **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Many job seekers, especially students and fresh graduates, lack access to **personalized interview preparation tools**.  
Most existing resources are generic and do not adapt to:
- Job roles  
- Required skills  
- Experience levels  

This results in poor interview readiness, increased anxiety, and reduced employment opportunities.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
The proposed system is an **AI-driven interview preparation assistant** that:

- Generates customized interview questions based on:
  - Job role
  - Skills
  - Experience level
- Supports multiple question types:
  - Technical
  - Behavioral
  - Scenario-based
  - Leadership
- Uses a **hybrid AI approach**:
  - AI API integration (prototype)
  - Rule-based fallback logic for reliability

---

## 🌍 SDG Alignment
### SDG 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth
This project supports SDG 8 by:
- Improving employment readiness  
- Supporting skill development  
- Providing inclusive access to interview preparation tools  
- Helping job seekers build confidence and competence  

---

## 🧠 System Architecture
1. User selects job role, skills, and experience level  
2. Input is processed using predefined mappings and AI prompt design  
3. Interview questions are generated using:
   - AI API (prototype integration)
   - Rule-based fallback logic  
4. Output is displayed via an interactive Gradio interface

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **Gradio** – Web-based user interface  
- **Hugging Face Inference API** – AI text generation (prototype)  
- **GitHub** – Source code hosting  
- **Hugging Face Spaces** – Application deployment

## 🧪 Features
- Role-specific interview question generation  
- Experience-level customization (Junior / Mid / Senior / Lead)  
- Multiple question categories  
- Interactive and user-friendly interface  
- Reliable fallback when AI API is unavailable  

---

## ⚠️ Note on AI Usage
AI API integration is implemented as a **prototype feature**.  
If API access is unavailable, the system automatically switches to a **rule-based fallback mode** to ensure continuous functionality.

---

## 📊 Expected Outcomes
- Enhanced interview readiness  
- Reduced preparation gaps  
- Improved employment confidence  
- Practical demonstration of applied AI concepts  

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Machine learning–based skill analysis  
- Automated answer evaluation and feedback  
- Resume analysis and job recommendation system  
- Multi-language interview preparation support  

---

## 🧾 Ethical Considerations
- The system provides **guidance only** and does not rank candidates  
- Care is taken to avoid biased or misleading recommendations  
- Transparency is maintained regarding the prototype nature of AI integration
